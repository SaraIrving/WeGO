# WeGo React Web Application

WeGO helps connect individuals and teams around real-world and online recreational activities. It accomplishes this by allowing users to find and join posted activities, and also to post their own activities for others to join. Activities display the current participants skill level, remaining players needed, location, and other useful information to help match the right people together for the right activity. 

## Key Features

- Sign up for an account
- Real time chat between activity hosts and users
- Chat notifications
- Activity notifications
- Geolocation shows relevant activities in your current city
- Advanced activity filtering
- Join, create, update, or delete activities
- Creating new activities displays an autogenerated relevant photo matching your activity tags
- Signing up randomly assigns unique and nifty avatars to users
- Accept or deny pending participants
- Remove accepted participants


### Tech stack

- React | PostgreSQL | Express | Node | Socket.io | Material UI | Sass


### Built on React + Express No-Fluff Boilerplate

The skeleton is a bootleg of @NimaBoscarino's [React Rails Boilerplate](https://github.com/NimaBoscarino/react-rails-boilerplate). It uses the same React app, but replaces the Rails server with an Express server.

The React project has `proxy` set to `localhost:8080` in the `package.json` file, and that the Express app listens to port 8080 in `server.js`.


## Getting started

- You need **TWO** terminal windows/tabs for this (or some other plan for running two Node processes).
- In one terminal, `cd` into `react-front-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies. Then run `npm start` or `yarn start`, and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.
- In the other terminal, `cd` into `express-back-end`. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies, then `npm start` or `yarn start` to launch the server.
- In the browser, you can click on the button and see the data get loaded.
